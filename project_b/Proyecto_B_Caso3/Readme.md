# Proyecto B Caso 3 - Offshore Critical Delivery (Re-Stock Variant)

## Overview

- The data structure is similar to the case 2 of this project, but in this case we have that the total sum of demands exeeds the total capacity of the vehicles. Meaning that we have to perform restock-operations

## Key considerations

- **START-TIME**: The time at which the operations begin is 7:45 AM.
- Maximum amount of restock operations: 8 (**Note this is not a restriction, But a guide on how many restocks you should expect**).
